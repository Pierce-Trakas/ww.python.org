        This should cover the following:
        Growth and Decay
        Rational Exponents
        Solving Exponential Equations
        Exponential Graphs & Transformations
        Logarithms

            Exponential Growth and Decay
        </h3>
        <p>
            Exponential Functions have a structure of y = a(r)^x, with a representing the initial value of the function (i.e. the y value of the function while intersecting the y-axis),
            and r representing the rate of growth or decay. If r is above 1, then the value of the function will grow as the x value increases. The opposite will occur if r is between 1 and 0.
