            Exponential Growth and Decay
        </h3>
        <p>
            Exponential Functions have a structure of y = a(r)<sup>x</sup>, with a representing the initial value of the function (i.e. the y value of the function while intersecting the y-axis),
            and r representing the rate of growth or decay. If r > 1, then the value of the function will grow as the x value increases. The opposite will occur if r is between 1 and 0.
            The gradual increase or decrease of exponential functions makes them a handy way to graph out compound interest.

        <p>
            Every exponential function has Asymptotes, which are lines that the function approaches, but does not cross. 
            Depending on how you transform the function, the asymptote's location will change, as well as the function's domain and range.

            Logarithms
        </h3>
        <p>
            To find out how many times a number has been multiplied (the x value) by itself in an exponential function when given the equation, 
            you can use Logarithms on your calculator. Logarithms are structured as x = log<sub>r</sub>(y), consisting of a base (r), exponent(x), and argument (y).
            An example is log<sub>10</sub>(100), which calculates the total amount of times that 100 can be divided by 10 while still being an integer, thus outputting 2 (since 10<sup>2</sup> is 100). 
            Another example is log<sub>2</sub>(64), which gives an answer of 6, as 2<sup>6</sup> is 64.
