Algebra

Algebra is used everywhere in our everyday lives. It is useful to find unknown values in equations.
Here is an example of a problem that you would use Algebra to solve:
    James is 18cm taller than Omar. The sum of their heights equals 334cm. Identify both boys' heights.

This may seem like a problem which you would need to plug in random values until both conditions are satisfied. However, with Algebra, you can figure out the correct value without having waste time trying different values over and over again.

So how does it work? Algebra revolves around **variables**. They are represented by letters, most commonly x and y. You may have seen them before. A **variable** represents an unknown value, usually the value that we are looking for, or the answer. 
For example, if we want to figure out what 5 + 3 is, we can placehold the answer using a variable: x. We write x = 5 + 3, and we will know that x = 8.
However, this doesn't seem very useful, because we already know what 5 + 3 is. Instead a more useful usage of variables is in more complex equations.
For example, let's say we want to find out what you'd need to add to 3 to obtain 5. So the question becomes: what + 3 = 5?
This is the perfect usage of Algebra, as we can use a variable to represent the unknown value: x + 3 = 5
To solve this equation, we can simply subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: (x + 3) - 3 = (5) - 3
This gives: x + 0 = 2
x = 2
The way to solve any equation using Algebra is to **isolate the variable**, meaning to simplify the equation until the variable sits on its own on one side of the equation. If you isolate the variable, then you would know exactly the value of the variable.

Another example: 5 + x/3 = 16
We get rid of the 5 by subtracting 5 from both sides: (5 + x/3) - 5 = (17) - 5
x/3 = 12
Then we get rid of the division by 3 by multiplying by 3 on both sides: (x/3) * 3 = (12) * 3
x = 36



Number Systems

A number system is a way to represent and work with numbers. It includes different types of numbers we use in math.


Here are the basic types of numbers in a number system:

Natural numbers (N)
    All positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...)
    **DOESN'T** include 0
Whole numbers (W)
    All non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, 3...)
    Includes 0
Integers (I)
    All integers (...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...)
Rational numbers (Q)
    All numbers that can be written as fractions (1/2, 2/9...)
Irrational numbers (sometimes written as P)
    All real numbers that are NOT rational
    CANNOT be written as fractions
    Ex:
        square root of 2 (1.41421356237...)
        π (3.14159265359...)
Real numbers
    All rational AND irrational numbers





Geometry


Angles
    Types of Angles:
    Acute angle: less than 90°
    Right angle: 90°
    Obtuse angle: more than 90° and less than 180°
    Straight angle: exactly 180°


Triangles
Types of Triangles
    Acute triangle: all angles are acute
    Right triangle: there is one right angle in the triangle
    Obtuse triangle: there is one obtuse angle in the triangle
    Equilateral triangle: all three sides of the triangle are the same length
    Isosceles triangle: two of the sides of the triangle are the same length
    Scalene triangle: all three sides of the triangle are different lengths

Properties of triangles:
    The sum of all three angles in a triangle is always 180°
    The exterior angle of a triangle is always the sum of the other two interior angles
    An equilateral triangle's angles are all 60°
    The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the square of the two side lengths adjacent to the right angle is equal to the square of the third side length.
